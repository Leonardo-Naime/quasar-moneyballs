# 💸 Moneyballs (quasar-moneyballs)

Moneyballs is a cross-platform wallet app built using [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/), [Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev/), and [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/).  
It allows users to **add**, **remove**, and **manage transactions**, simulating the behavior of a personal finance tracker.

This project was developed as part of a course on Vue 3 and serves as an educational tool to explore modern frontend concepts like the **Composition API**, **mobile/desktop hybrid development**, and **state management** using Quasar's ecosystem.
